POSSIBLY OUTDATED

movement functions:

void odomDriveToPoint(double x, double y, bool forward=true, double offset = 0.0, double speedMultiplier = 1, double time = 4, bool persist = false, bool rush = false, int useVision = 0);
x is forward/backward
y is left/right
forward is default to true
offset: try to avoid using this; it doesnt work with jcurve if its negative; ONLY use it IF you are OVERSHOOTING by a little bit and want to save time by just cutting the distance without recalculating coordinates
speedMultiplier is max speed
time is max time in seconds
persist is for use in auton; enabling it causes the bot to switch to torque and back up when encountering resistance
rush is for use in auton; enabling it will cause it to go at full speed and stop instantly when reaching target OR when bumper is pressed
useVision: 0 is off, 1 is front vision, 2 is back vision

void jCurve(double x, double y, bool forward=true, double offset = 0.0, double speedMultiplier = 1, double time = 4, bool persist = false, bool rush = false, int useVision = 0);
same thing but jCurve

void imuTurnToAngle(double deg);
you literally wrote this

void imuZeroToAngle(double deg, double time = 2);
hi

void relative(double x, double time = 2);
relative forward/backward movement
